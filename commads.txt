aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-1 --name expense-dev

ls -la 
there will be a .kube/ file
there will be a cat config 

What is this .kube means the file which holds the cluster information both authenticate and authorization

check weather the nodes are running or not

to upgrade we should taint the latest nodes so that no new pod will be created

kubectl taint nodes <ip address> project=expense:NoSchedule

Now upgrade control pane manually

shift workloads from 1.29 node group to 1.30 node group 

kubectl cordon <node name> # old node cordon

# untaint
kubectl taint nodes <ip address> project=expense:NoSchedule-  

# drain
kubectl drain --ignore-daemonsets <node>  # old node drain delete


Check the pods are there in administration system

kubectl get pods -n kube-system -o wide
